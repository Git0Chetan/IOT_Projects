# INDUSTRY ALERT SYSTEM

The Wi-Fi-based industry alerting system is a project that aims to improve the efficiency and safety of industrial operations. The system uses Wi-Fi-enabled sensors and devices to monitor the parameters of various industrial processes and generate alerts when any parameter deviates from its normal range. The alerts can be sent to the concerned personnel via Cloud on the Blynk Application or on the personal email, allowing them to take corrective actions before any damage occurs. The project has the potential to reduce downtime, prevent accidents, and save costs associated with repairs and replacements.
